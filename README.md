# Franka Teleoperation Simulation
The project integrates RGB-D rendering in MuJoCo to generate accurate point clouds from a simulated Franka Panda robot, enabling perception and grasping research. It also focuses on sim-to-real transfer by matching simulated depth data to real-world sensor outputs for consistent 3D environment understanding.
